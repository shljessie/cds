630,"A reminder that nonprofits are going to feel the effects of the coronavirus?봟oth from cancelled events and a sagging economy. At the same time, times of crisis are when nonprofits and their services are needed the most. "
631,"Right now - Congress is running around screaming ?쐂o something??with absolutely no regard to any fiscal responsibility or its obligation to encourage calm, a quick resolution of Corona, and a strong economy. Stop. Think. Lead. #coronavirus"
632,@realDonaldTrump in a few days a pandemic you could?셶e minimized will shut the U.S. down. The economy is tanking. Americans will begin needlessly dying. Even more people will see you for the pathetic buffoon you are. The only hoax is you?셱e a leader. #coronavirus

634,Let the #coronavirus crisis serve as a wake up call for states like Florida. No more corporate tax cuts and more focus on public needs like access to healthcare. Our economy thrives when our workforce is happy &amp; healthy. 
635,The official Florida #coronavirus shutdown order has landed. Our tourism economy needs Congress to enact a UBI fast to support the millions of service industry workers whose livelihoods are interrupted by the #CoronavirusOutbreak. If only the President believed testing helps...

645,There wasn?셳 a single WARN notice filed this week by a Michigan employer for layoffs of more than 100 employees at the same company related to the #coronavirus.

647,Now is NOT the time for politics. Senate Dems & Nancy Pelosi need to quit playing political games & support the Coronavirus relief bill they co-wrote in the first place. Enough is enough. Lives are at stake. The economy is at stake. Families &amp; workers need help NOW.
648,"What?셲 next: At the end of the 15-day shutdown period, there will likely be a serious clash between the public health experts versus the president and his economic and political aides, who are anxious to restart the economy."
649,The Trump economy has turned into the Trump virus. Just as he tried to take all the credit for a strong economy he now needs to take responsibility for the lack of preparedness for controlling and treating the rapid spread of the Coronavirus in the U.S.
650,Tell me again how there was nothing political behind this insanity. I see @realDonaldTrump is starting to question the logic behind destroying the American economy over this also. #IA01 #KAG2020LandslideVictory https://fxn.ws/2wztuiD #FoxNews
651,We have to stop thinking about the next election and start thinking about the next generation. What are we going to leave to our children if Democrats allow this economy to crash? Let?셲 pass the CARES Act for immediate #coronavirus relief! 
652,DEVELOPING: Proposed legislation meant to shore up the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic includes a recommendation to create a digital dollar. @nikhileshde reports @SpeakerPelosi @RepMaxineWaters
653,"the fear is not that coronavirus will destroy the ""economy."" it's that the political measures necessary to keep people alive will now require and enable large-scale redistribution of wealth and resources."
654,"Trump says there will be more ""death"" keeping economy shut than letting coronavirus spread. WOW."
655,So at this point in this presser listening to Trump complain about the impact #Coronavirus is having on the economy and his rush now to ?쐎pen the economy??(despite serious advice to the contrary?? one has a clearer sense of what he values. It ain?셳 us.
656,He basically said he?셲 reopening the economy in a week and the flu and car crashes are worse than coronavirus. This is really happening.

In a piece he wrote last week, which has circulated in the Trump admin, he predicted that only ~500 Americans would die from COVID-19: https://www.hoover.org/research/coronavirus-isnt-pandemic US deaths passed 500 yesterday."

663,Leaving #coronavirus response to states won't work. If a governor reopens business as usual it undermines efforts of others as interstate travel spreads virus. States will close borders + roadblock highways. That'll have an even worse impact on the economy. Need federal response. 
664,"There is no economy if the Coronavirus overwhelms, sickens and kills the American people. Why is that so complicated for the President to understand? #SocialDistancing"
665,"Pres Trump has repeatedly said he believes more ppl will die from economy being slowed because of social distancing to prevent coronavirus spread than from the virus itself. So far, this theory has not been backed by any experts or health officials but Trump firmly believes it."
666,"Bill Gates calls for ""extreme shutdown"" for at least 6-10 weeks. It will be ""disastrous"" for the economy but necessary, he says. ""There really is no middle ground,"" he says. ""We did not act fast enough to have the ability to avoid a shutdown."""
