331,The People's Republic of #China's governments handling of #Coronavirus in #Wuhan is borderline deliberate genocide. Millions are literally being bolted into their homes &amp; receiving no medical treatment. They will either die from the illness being untreated or die from starvation.
332,If the Coronavirus hits the USA in a significant way will the government step in and provide free healthcare to combat this pandemic or will US citizens be left to live or die based on the quality of their health insurance? #Medicare4All #Bernie2020

343,"2 weeks ago, the number of coronavirus cases in Italy was less than what it currently is in the UK and now the entire country is in lockdown. Meanwhile, the government's masterplan to tackle it is to tell the British public to sing ""happy birthday"" while washing your hands 🤦🏻‍♂️"
344,Today England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said that if the government took extreme measures to stop the spread of coronavirus too early “people will understandably get fatigued”. You know what’s pretty damn fatiguing Chris? Having pneumonia caused by Covid-19.
345,Honoured to be appointed a health minister today. Responsible for life sciences. Committed to supporting @DHSCgovuk response to the #coronavirus challenge. Proud to be part of government’s @UKHouseofLords front bench team. – at House of Lords
346,Boris Johnson’s government continues to refuse to suspend flights to the UK from quarantined areas of Northern Italy. So if you live in Milan and the Italian authorities won’t let you travel to Rome you can just fly via London and you will be fine. #COVID2019 #coronavirus
347,How can our government advise against travel to Coronavirus affected areas like northern Italy and yet allow direct flights from there into the country...? Completely counterproductive and quite ridiculous. #coronvirusireland
348,The latest coronavirus infection &amp; fatality figures from Italy are truly grim. I see no reason why it will be any different here in the UK eventually. I just hope that our government has the courage to take the firm action to halt the spread of Covid-19 that we now see in Italy.
349,Making coronavirus roughly as dangerous as the Tory government!

357,private clinics (like the one on harley street charging £375 for a coronavirus test) should absolutely have their property and testing facilities seized by the government for the foreseeable. when the nhs is so under resourced it would be dangerously irresponsible not to do so
358,Many private schools are closing because of coronavirus but the government refuses to close state schools. Parents that want to keep their children out of school should simply tell the school someone in their household has Covid-19 symptoms and therefore they are self-isolating.
359,I think the government led by #rishisunak has 2go all in on #coronavirus &amp; support vulnerable businesses &amp; citizens “whatever it takes”. I really don’t think this is a time to be worrying overly about the national debt. It soared in ww2 it may have to again.
360,"In India, once you test positive for Coronavirus, the government would order that you stay at home for 14 days. They will also stamp your hand so IF you are found outside, it is a crime and you can be arrested. Nigeria, let’s not wait for this to happen. #NigeriaNeedsATravelBan"

373,JUST IN: The whole of Denmark has been shut down for 14 days due to Coronavirus. Denmark has NOT had any Coronavirus deaths. The government is trying to prevent a health system collapse should there be a massive outbreak.
374,This is very powerful data. Underscores government commitment to transparency. Thanks to @PHE_uk colleagues. #COVID19 #coronavirus 👇👇 
375,"It's nice to uncover s bit of government propoganda,and today is budget day,the government have said that the NHS will receive what it needs to defeat coronavirus,so a train of beds followed by 50,000 nurses and a cartload of doctors plus millions of pounds of equipment maybe 😷"
376,One consequence of the coronavirus pandemic is that today’s Budget will spend less time in the headlines than any Budget in my lifetime. This provides an excellent opportunity for this Tory government to sneak in unpopular measures with little scrutiny. You have been warned!

380,Is the government losing the fight against the coronavirus? Yesterday the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK grew by 52%. If the number of new cases announced today is more than 18 this would represent exponential growth of Covid-19 in the UK.
381,Capitalism demands that people act in their own economic self-interest. This includes going into work when you have an infectious disease even though you might make others ill. Only decent levels of sick pay can stop capitalism boosting the growth of the coronavirus.
382,"I hope this recent crisis shows that those at the bottom performing so called unskilled work are just as important to the UK economy as high flying bankers, hedge fund managers and the like. Let's hope once this crisis is over they are treated and rewarded as such. #coronavirus"
