## How are people responding to Coronavirus?

#### Description of Project
This project will mainly focus on understanding the global atmosphere of people’s responses to Coronavirus. We have mainly chosen the top 10 countries with the most cases: China, Italy, United States, Spain, Germany, Iran, France, Switzerland, South Korea, UK (2020.03.25, last updated) We will take twitter hashtag keywords to analyze people’s responses through the popular searches. Then we will compare this with the number of outbreaks in each country to see how people’s responses are in each country. 

At the end of the project, we aim to create a data visualization that reads in the updated information on both the coronavirus cases as well as Tweets regarding the coronavirus.

#### How the Data will be Analyzed
We will analyze mainly two types of data. 
Updated coronavirus data from each country
Infections
Deaths
Number of tests that are being done

Twitter data
